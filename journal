backend - python - RESTAPI:

docker:
    docker error with socket even when givin the right group and share the socket correctly
    "ERROR: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock:"
    problem is that the groups in the host and the jenkins is the same name but no the same id 
    so need to change the grpid in the jenkins container to the same as in the host
    fixing steps:
        * checked with `getent group docker` the host docker gid
        * added the following cmd the the jenkins docker file `RUN groupmod -g <gid> docker` before `RUN usermod -a -G docker jenkins`
