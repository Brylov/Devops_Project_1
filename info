docker:
    docker error with socket even when givin the right group and share the socket correctly
    "ERROR: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock:"
    problem is that the groups in the host and the jenkins is the same name but no the same id 
    so need to change the grpid in the jenkins container to the same as in the host
    fixing steps:
        * checked with `getent group docker` the host docker gid
        * added the following cmd the the jenkins docker file `RUN groupmod -g <gid> docker` before `RUN usermod -a -G docker jenkins`

    github:
        made a faulty commit with senstive data (creds of mongo) and pushed it to github,
        fixed it by this steps:
        adding the file/folder to .gitignore
        ```
        git add .gitignore
        git commit -m "Add sensitive file to .gitignore 
        git rm --cached path/to/sensitive/file #to untrack the sensetive file/folder
        git commit -m "Remove sensitive file from tracking"
        git push origin dev
        git log # check what commit i need to delete
        git rebase -i HEAD~N  #(Replace N with the number of commits to go back i.e if its the third commit so HEAD~3)
        # deleting the commit line from the file and save
        git rebase --continue
        git push origin dev --force
        ```
